Aproach to solve the problem : - 
1.First is  that wwe will sort the given array so that we could perform the combination of no. very easily. 
2.then we could intilaise a fuction that would form two no. from the given array elements in possible two  combinations then it would  compare both the combinations and work as following 
3.if combination 2 is true then it would return 1 else -1 program work accordingly 
4.at the ennd of the program the result  will be displayed in form of a string combination. 

CONCEPT USED : 
in the given program a basic concept that is been used is the conceept of combination of string .
